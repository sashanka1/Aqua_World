# Aqua_World
 
# Hello, Welcome to my website.(https://aqua-world.vercel.app/)
My name is Sashanka sekhar samal.
Let's start-
I have created a website named as Aqua World an e-commerce website that deals with aquarium products and ornamental fish
I created this website with the help of React and for the backend, I used express, node js and for the database, I used MongoDB.

To start use the command - npm start.
Navbar - It contains the app logo, search box, cart logo with cart product count and setting logo- onclick,  a popup will open with options (login, sign in, address, logout)
Home page - Have photos of products, onclick on that redirect to the product page with relevant products.
